<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<p>Silicon Valley Pet Project (SVPP) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization of volunteers committed to saving local at-risk shelter pets through rescue, community involvement and education. Our organization is focused on creating solutions that are repeatable and scalable. We&rsquo;re inspired by national models such as <a href="http://nkla.org/" target="_blank">No-Kill Los Angeles</a> and <a href="http://www.austinpetsalive.org" target="_blank">Austin Pets Alive!</a>, and we bring passion and know-how to our community.</p>

<h1>Our Organization</h1>

<p>Our organization is structured into dedicated teams focused on rescue operations, foster parent support, marketing and communications, volunteer management, development, community outreach and more.</p>

<p>We embrace teamwork, professionalism and flexibility in our organization, all with the goal of helping more animals in our community.</p>

<p>SVPP strives to make the experience of volunteering, fostering, adopting and/or donating to our organization rewarding, educational, supportive and community-focused. We are an animal welfare organization that is first and foremost a people organization. We could not do what we do without every person who volunteers, fosters, adopts or donates to SVPP.</p>

<p>The animals that need our help deserve the best of the best, and in Silicon Valley, we have that!</p>

<h1>Our Pets</h1>

<p>SVPP is a rescue partner with the <a href="http://www.sanjoseanimals.com" target="_blank">San Jose Animal Care Center</a> (SJACC), Silicon Valley&rsquo;s largest municipal animal shelter. SVPP rescues, rehabilitates and rehomes both cats and dogs of all breeds, as well as senior and special-needs pets, that are at-risk of euthanasia. These animals may need medical or behavioral care. We value our partnership status with the San Jose Animal Care Center, and work closely with them on special-needs cases.</p>

<p>As we have no central facility, rescued pets are fostered and nurtured in volunteers&rsquo; homes in the Bay Area. SVPP&rsquo;s growing network of compassionate and skilled volunteers provide individualized support and advice to these foster families every step of the way.</p>

<p>While a significant portion of our time and resources goes to assessing, rehabilitating and rehoming these at-risk animals, we are also focused on bringing awareness to the plight of homeless animals in Silicon Valley through local outreach events. One day soon we hope to have a space that will serve as a community gathering place for like-minded people to meet our adoptable animals, learn more about our mission, and unite in a desire to assist our local shelter in achieving no-kill status.</p>

<h1>Our Goal &ndash; A Community Center</h1>

<p>Our five year plan includes procuring a facility to supplement our foster home network, as well as providing a valuable resource for pet guardians in our community. We envision this facility as a community center offering support services, obedience and behavioral training, educational opportunities, volunteer training, etc.</p>

<p>SVPP opened <a href="http://svpetproject.rescuegroups.org/info/display?PageID=17104" target="_blank">The Dancing Cat</a> (TDC), an adoption center for adult cats, in May 2016. TDC is the first step toward our goal of having a full-service community center in Silicon Valley.</p>

<h1>Our Vision</h1>

<p>Silicon Valley Pet Project is a community catalyst for changing the lives of shelter pets.</p>
