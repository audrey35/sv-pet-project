<p>Thu Tran is an animal lover and a passionate animal advocate who has been working in the high-tech industry since 1980. Currently, she is working on her 10-year plan to retire from her full-time job to become a full-time volunteer.</p>

<p>As Thu&rsquo;s human children grew up and chartered to their new lives, her home stays filled with her four-legged loves.</p>

<p>It all started when a stray kitten was brought home for a week to find a home in 2007 and after a name was given, Indie found his forever home. Since then, Thu had adopted her other two cats (Tinkie and Charlie) and her dog (Sadie) through her volunteering at the local San Jose animal shelter.</p>

<p>Thu resides in Willow Glen and has a long time sweetheart, Tim; three equally wonderful three children, Tony, Stephanie, and Belle; and an adorable granddaughter, Elly.</p>
