<p>Do you have a little extra space in your home, a bit of free time, and some love to share? If so, consider becoming a foster parent for homeless kittens. Not only does becoming a volunteer foster parent help save lives, you get to experience the joy of kittens again and again. It is so gratifying to see the kittens grow and develop, and go to excellent forever homes!</p>

<p>The kittens will be big enough to eat on their own but not old enough for adoption yet. Once they reach 2 lbs (approximately 2 months of age) they can be spayed/neutered, vaccinated and put up for adoption.</p>

<p>In return for your loving care, we provide donated food and supplies, excellent marketing exposure for your fosters and cover all approved medical costs. We will pair you up with an SVPP &quot;buddy&quot; who will get answers to your questions and make sure you feel supported all along the foster journey.</p>

<p>Fill out our <a href="http://www.svpetproject.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=3391">Cat Foster Application</a> if you are ready for some kitten therapy this season. The kittens need you!</p>

<p>Have you fostered kittens before? We know that most people agree to foster because they&rsquo;ve talked to people who&rsquo;ve given them a first-hand account of the benefits and rewards of fostering a homeless pet. For this reason our best source for finding new foster homes for our rescued pets is YOU. Talk to your friends about fostering and ask them to complete our <a href="http://www.svpetproject.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=3391">SVPP Cat Foster Application</a>.</p>
