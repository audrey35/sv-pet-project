<p>Lisa has over 25 years of experience in international human resources in the high tech industry in Silicon Valley. She has an extensive background in global leadership, executive coaching, development and performance management. She received her BS from St. Mary&rsquo;s College of California.</p>

<p>While raising her two daughters, her family had many cats, birds and other small pets. However, she became a first-time dog owner after realizing that her empty nest was too quiet. Since that experience, she has dedicated her skills as a board member of Silicon Valley Pet Project to help create a sustainable organization with a focus on Volunteer Management and Board Development.</p>

<p>For me, it all started with an adorable golden-doodle puppy that I named Farley. Farley was my first dog and I am amazed by his intelligence and his sweet nature. He is a wonderful companion and filled my empty nest with energy and love.</p>

<p>I soon realized that I had bought Farley from a puppymill. As I learned more about puppy mills I decided it was time to do something. I started exploring different local rescues to learn more about animal rescue. This is how I met and adopted my sweet second dog, Zoey who added extra spice to my home.</p>

<p>As I looked for an opportunity to make a difference in my community, I had the good fortune to meet a group of professionals who wanted to create a new kind of animal rescue organization &ndash; one that could have a significant impact on local shelter pets and one that would engage with the community in innovative ways to change the perception of the &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; pet.</p>
