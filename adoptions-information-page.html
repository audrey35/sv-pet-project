<p>Are you interested in meeting one of our adoptable pets? Please complete our online application below. Once we have received your online adoption application, we will be in contact with you to arrange a meeting.</p>

<p>Also note that all of our rescue pets are in private foster homes and meetings will be coordinated with foster parents. Typically, after you meet the rescue pet, we will follow up with you to see how the meeting went. If a match is made, we can finalize the adoption quickly. Please note that we may require a home check as part of the application process.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t find what you were looking for? <a href="mailto:info@svpetproject.org?subject=Want%20to%20make%20a%20match">Ask us</a> about our pets in foster care. They may not be listed on our website yet.</p>

<p>Also, if we cannot make a match with one of our adoptable pets, we will be happy to help you find a pet with another reputable rescue organization.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting adoption.</p>

<h3>Golden Paws Program (Seniors for Seniors)</h3>

<p>The companionship and devotion of a pet is something that brings joy to life. Golden Paws Program is designed to give our older animals the opportunity to be placed in a loving home by matching them with senior citizens who are 65 years +. An older animal would be a great choice for an older person that needs a buddy! Adoption fees are discounted 50%.</p>

<h3>Adopt-A-Buddy Program (Buddy Program)</h3>

<p>We realize the importance of having a buddy! Adopt a second pet from us at time of adoption (or within a month) and receive a discounted adoption fee. We believe it is emotionally healthy for animals to have a friend and have found that some behavioral issues can easily be solved or never occur with the addition of a second pet into a household. Second Adoption fee is 50% off.</p>
