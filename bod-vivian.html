<p>After graduating from the University of Dallas with a Masters in Politics, Vivian worked as a Development Research Specialist at the University of Dallas. She also served as the Associate Director of Major Gifts and Development Research with the Boy Scouts of America.</p>

<p>Vivian has always cared deeply about animal and human rights. As a seasoned advocate and volunteer with great determination, passion and energy, she has devoted her time to many volunteer efforts including Men&rsquo;s Homeless Shelter, American Women&#39;s Group, Federation of American Women&#39;s Club and St. Francis Animal Protection Society.</p>

<p>Serving on the SVPP Board of Directors has allowed her to follow her life-long passion by taking on a more active role in advocacy for animals.</p>

<p>My animal rescue story begins with my husband. In 1989 he found a tiny, emaciated kitten alone in a field and took her home. We were living in Dallas, TX at the time and little did I know but that kitten (who lived with us for the next 23 years) was the beginning of what I consider my life&rsquo;s work. We were living near a college campus and for the first time, I encountered feral and community cat colonies. I was shocked by the number of cats (many of whom were clearly former pets) that were struggling to survive &ndash; and at the same time were multiplying in large numbers every kitten season. I did not know there was a term for my activities but I began a Trap/Neuter/Return (TNR) program with the help of a very generous and compassionate veterinarian. During those six years we spayed/neutered and provided basic medical treatment to a large number of cats. I found homes for many kittens and even some of the so called &ldquo;feral&rdquo; adults. And yes, many of them did find their forever homes within my own family.</p>

<p>In 1998 we also rescued our beloved dog Blue. We found Blue running frantically across a busy, dark road one night and when we finally caught her we realized she was in terrible condition &ndash; a telephone cord tied tightly around her neck and covered in hundreds of engorged ticks. We wanted to help her but we had no intention of keeping her. Within a few days, however, she had a name and a home. This most amazing dog was my constant companion and filled our lives with joy for the next 16 years.</p>

<p>There have been many moves and many rescue stories since Dallas, however, during those years I was primarily acting as an independent rescuer. It wasn&rsquo;t until I moved to California in 2011 that I became involved in a community of people and a rescue group (St. Francis Animal Protection Society) that allowed me to have a larger impact on saving homeless animals.</p>
