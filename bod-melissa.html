<p>Melissa brings extensive experience in leadership, project management, legal administration, and training, having spent the majority of her career working at corporate law firms. Most recently, Melissa has founded and managed 2 animal welfare nonprofit organizations and run rescue operations for a local rescue group. Due to these efforts, thousands of local shelter pets have been saved.</p>

<p>Melissa shares her life with her husband Stephen, two rescue kitties, Newbie and Henry, and two rescue dogs, Chloe Clementine and Greta Lou.</p>

<p>Pets have helped me during times of major change in my life and, upon learning about the challenges faced at our local animal shelter, I decided to take action and try to bring more awareness to these issues.</p>

<p>In 2010, I founded <a href="http://sjanimaladvocates.org"> San Jose Animal Advocates</a>, a social media network used to promote animals at risk of euthanasia at our local municipal shelter. With the tagline of &ldquo;Share to Save a Life&rdquo;,&nbsp;SJAA has become a vibrant online community of compassionate individuals who share local shelter pets facing euthanasia via social media. Since 2010, SJAA has directly or indirectly facilitated the rescue of thousands of animals.</p>

<p>In 2012, I founded <a href="http://cancercompanionpets.org">Cancer Companion Pets</a>, a nonprofit organization with the mission of improving the physical and emotional well-being of those living with cancer through&nbsp;the joys of pet companionship. As a two&nbsp;time cancer survivor, I know first-hand the healing power of pets.</p>

<p>While working on these two initiatives, I also learned firsthand the challenges of running an animal rescue group when I managed the operations of <a href="http://stfrancisanimal.org"> St. Francis Animal Protection Society</a>. From September 2012 to early 2015, we saved over 500 animals, most of them from the San Jose municipal shelter.</p>

<p>Homeless animals that end up in our local municipal shelter deserve the kind of support Silicon Valley, with its enviable resources and innovative business practices, is known for. SVPP hopes to engage the community in new ways to rescue these deserving shelter pets and place them in loving, permanent homes.</p>
