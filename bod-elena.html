<p>As long as Elena can remember she has always been surrounded by animals. There were cats and dogs, fish and birds, and even horses and cows.</p>

<p>An avid reader at a very young age, she discovered a book&mdash;The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery&mdash;that changed her perception of animals forever and the quote from that book became her motto: &ldquo;you become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After graduating from the Glazov State Pedagogical Institute with a BA in Foreign Languages and Pedagogy, Elena worked with the Spanish Consulate in Moscow. She spent many years traveling to different places and no matter where she was; she always found an animal in need that she was ready to help.</p>

<p>Elena is passionate about animal welfare and protection. She cares about the ethical treatment and well being of all animals no matter how small, sick, or insignificant their lives may seem. She truly believes that spaying and neutering companion animals is the first and most vital step in saving lives.</p>

<p>She was one of the first volunteers to join the San Jose Municipal Shelter in 2004 and she has logged thousands of hours helping homeless animals in Silicon Valley. She has been involved with many different rescue organizations and she and her husband have fostered more than 600 animals over the course of those years. Their home has seen a lot of special needs animals that required intensive medical and emotional care.</p>

<p>Elena deeply believes that companionship of animals is incredibly beneficial for people. She has a therapy dog and they visit hospitals, assisted living faculties, and convalescent centers to enhance the lives of their patients and residents.</p>
