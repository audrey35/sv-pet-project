<p>After graduating from The University of North Texas with a BFA in Advertising Art, Cathy spent several years in retail visual merchandising. She went on to pursue positions in corporate marketing and communications working both in-house and on a freelance basis for several different companies in the Dallas area. Once relocated to San Jose, Cathy&#39;s background in art and visual merchandising laid the groundwork for starting her own business as a professional organizer.</p>

<p>A long time animal lover, Cathy feels very fortunate for the opportunity to apply her professional skills to the cause of animal welfare full time. Previous to Silicon Valley Pet Project, she volunteered for the City of Plano, Texas Animal Services. In San Jose, she has served in a variety of volunteer positions for St. Francis Animal Protection Society, including Adoption Coordinator, Dog Adoption Event lead, Facebook Administrator and foster home. Her current roles with SVPP include Secretary for the Board of Directors, Marketing &amp; Communications Department co-lead, Social Media Manager and Animal Operations Committee member.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve been surrounded by rescue animals. Throughout my childhood my family had guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, owls, lizards and tadpoles (some of them may or may not have needed rescuing).</p>

<p>Today my husband and I foster dogs for Silicon Valley Pet Project, have our own little Chiweenie (imported directly from the San Jose animal shelter) and have just found our next Golden Retriever through Rescued Love From Taiwan.</p>

<p>I am quite active in my local neighborhood of Willow Glen and am proud to live in such an animal-friendly area where residents look out for each other and their pets. I look forward to the day when the San Jose municipal animal shelter is seen by us all as an ally in the fight against senseless euthanasia. I am committed to spreading the word in my community as to how the shelter and its rescue partners work together to make a positive impact on at-risk animals.</p>
